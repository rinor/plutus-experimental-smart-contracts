Plutus Experimental Smart Contacts
-----------------------------------

This repo holds smart contracts which I am writing in order to experiment with the Plutus Platform. They are very likely to have obvious oversights and may be easily abused. This is on purpose as they are designed to test specific ideas, not to be perfectly implemented or safe to use. Thus when mainnet launches, do not use these.

However feel free to hop on over to the Plutus Playground to test the code out for yourself: https://prod.playground.plutus.iohkdev.io/
